# Scoping the utility of "technical abatement/mitigation potential" analysis for biodiversity consevration
Repository for the analysis of "Technical [biodiversity & ecosystem] mitigation potential of protected areas, avoiding habitat loss and restoration in Australia" which will be submitted as a publication in 2022. This analysis was led by Carla Archibald and data collation was assisted by Brett Bryan, Michalis Hadjikakou and Emily Nicholson.

This repository will contain all data, code and documentation to reproduce the:

1. Calculate the available spatial footprint for different conservation actions in Australia 
2. Calculate the technical potential for each conservation action to contribute to a suite of conservation and sustainability indicators.

This analysis was done as a part of the @land-use-trade-offs project.
